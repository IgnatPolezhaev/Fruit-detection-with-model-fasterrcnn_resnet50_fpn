# Fruit-detection-with-model-fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn
In this repository, fruit is detected from the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbkinaci/fruit-images-for-object-detection). To do this, the Pytorch pre-trained fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn model is used. Quality is measured using accuracy and IoU metrics. As a result, after training, the F1 quality of the measure was obtained at 0.87.
